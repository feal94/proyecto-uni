# proyecto-uni
This is my private repo, where the Django files for my last uni project (TFG in Spanish) are stored.
The task for this Django app is to provide future galician students with a tool to help them in the process of choosing a career to study. 
As soon as this project is turned in, the files will be made public!

---- Update! ----

This projet has been turned in and so this is now a public repo!

We are currently working on deciding the future lines of proyecto-uni, while focusing on making the project avaliable for use through a public web page.
